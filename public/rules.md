# Rules
**Discord** has already made some neat rules, we in the administration (Administrators, Moderators, Helpers and Supporters) expects you to both read these rules and follow them. You can find them [here](https://discordapp.com/guidelines).

Disobeying the rules made in the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines) will have you either banned or kicked, the executioner ("The person who is banning or kicking you") will write a report containing your `ID`, `Tag` and the `IDs` to the messages you've sent that goes against the Discord Community Guidelines


### Behavior
1. Respect the administration and all the members of this server.
  * American laws does also count for this server. We require that every user follows the American laws regardless where one lives. Learn more about American laws [here](https://www.usa.gov/laws-and-regs).
    
  * Anti-discrimination rules has been put in order for this Discord Server, any discrimination in type of the ones listed in [this](#/extra/antidiscrimination) page is either bannable or kickable, without warning.

2. Keep bad behaviour for yourself.
  * No one likes ~~dick~~tards that keeps up with a bad behavior, if you want to be a moron, be it somewhere else.
    
  * Being a douchebag may result in being muted, forwarded to kick then a ban.
  
  * If you see someone who is being an asshole you will report them using the `Codie` bot. Learn more on how to report people with the bot [here](#/utorial/bot-report).

### Chatting Rooms
1. [Not Safe For Work](#/extra/nsfw) content goes to a NSFW sub network on the server. Nowhere else.
  * "Some content just isn't appropriate for kids under 18", if you don't find any NSFW channels it is because you haven't assigned yourself to the NSFW role. Find more information about this [here](#/tutorial/register-nsfw).
    
  * If you have been banned from a NSFW sub-network and don't have any other place to post NSFW content, enjoy that content for yourself.
    
  * Sending NSFW content in channels that are not made for NSFW *can* get you banned from the [sub-network](#/extra/sub-network)

2. Content that is categorised to a certain category will be published in a certain channel. For example javascript programming goes in [#javascript](https://discordapp.com/channels/398773906212913154/398848197948080138) channel.
  * Breaking this rule multiple times will result in being banned from the sub network or being muted for a certain amount of time. The more you break these rules the longer you will be muted for each time. (This does not matter what channel you post in, because the [bot](#/bot) will automatically measure the mute duration.)
